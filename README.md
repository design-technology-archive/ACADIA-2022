# ACADIA-2022
A data-driven approach for urban design and master planning development

LEADER(S): Jorge Sainz de Aja Curbelo - Urban Computation Manager at Grimshaw & 
Esther Rubio Madronal â€“ Computational Design Specialist at Grimshaw 

AFFILIATION: Grimshaw

APPLICABLE SOFTWARE:
R Studio IDE (with R 4.0 or higher) for ETL, spatial analysis and visualization/data mapping purposes 
Rhinoceros 3D (7) 
Grasshopper for the development of a parametric urban design model 
UNA Toolbox for advanced Space Syntax integration in Rhinoceros 3D (https://cityform.mit.edu/projects/una-rhino-toolbox) 
R studio and UNA Toolbox are open software and do not require any licensing 

CAPACITY OF WORKSHOP: 20

DESCRIPTION: The workshop proposes an overview of different techniques and methodologies around spatial analysis for urban design and master-planning projects, through the implementation and processing of different spatial open data sets that will ultimately inform a theoretical urban development proposal. 
Using a scripting language (R) for ETL processes, and it is interoperability with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, the workshop will explore different geocomputation techniques and methodologies to create a data-driven approach to urban design and master planning model capable of generating multiple scenarios based on dedicated KPIs and more specifically the use of Space Syntax theory to allocate different land use and its quantum distribution on a parametric urban design model. 
The final part of the workshop will explore other possible development environments and outcomes such as web apps or Rhino compute integration to trigger a Q&A session about next steps and integration of other relevant workflows.
